	<ul>
		<li>When listing all of patientâ€™s important issues, you can choose to list each issues separately or to lump issues that are likely to be related to one etiology.
			<ul>
				<li>For example, you can list issues for a particular patient as:
					<ol>
						<li>Sepsis</li>
						<li>Pneumonia</li>
						<li>COPDe</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>or call it:
					<ol>
						<li>Pneumosepsis with COPD</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>or call it:
					<ol>
						<li>Hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Splitting the issues to many discrete problems may be helpful for inexperienced clerks as this method allows clerks to think about each issues thoroughly.</li>
		<li>Lumping the issues could be helpful for a more experienced clerks as this method reduces redundancy in the problem list.</li>
		<li>We will go through another case example, but this time, try to see if you can lump together 2 important issues!</li>
