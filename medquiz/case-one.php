	<p>You are a 3rd year medical student on the VGH CTU team. Your senior resident asks you to see Mr. Paul Monaré, a 63 year old male with known history of COPD presenting to the emergency department with 2 day history of increased shortness of breath (SOB) on exertion.</p>
	<p>Paul was his usual self until 2 days ago, then he began feeling SOB on his usual walk around neighborhood. Paul notes usually, can walk 10 blocks, now, has to stop after 2 blocks. Paul denies any SOB at rest. He feels his symptoms are getting worse, to a point where he has SOB walking down the hospital hall. Paul feels his symptoms are better after using his puffer, but not completely resolved.</p>
	<p>Paul notes he also has “sharp discomfort in his chest, brought on by deep breath” but is not exertional and is not otherwise reproducible. He has also noticed increased cough x 2days, says usually has a dry cough but now is coughing up yellowish phlegm.</p>
	<p>On review of systems, Paul denies any fever, nausea, vomiting, unintended weight loss, night sweat, recent travel history, sick contacts, recent surgeries/flights, leg pain or hemoptysis. Paul has not received his influenza or pneumococcal vaccine this year.</p>
</div>

<div id="page-two">
	<p>Paul has a known previous diagnosis of COPD and is being followed by a respirologist with the most recent FEV1 being 70% 3 months ago. He is also a type 2 diabetic on metformin with most recent A1C of 7.1% 3 months ago.</p>
	<p>Paul notes he takes Ventolin puffer prn and metformin only. Denies any other OTC medications or herbal medications. He does not have any known allergies.</p>
	<p>Paul lives independently at home in Vancouver with wife and 3 daughters. He is a retired teacher and has 40 pack year smoking history which he quit 10 years ago. He drinks about 1-2 beer cans/week and denies any recreational drug use. His family history and review of systems are non-contributory. </p>
	<p>On examination, Paul appeared well, not in respiratory distress with normal vital signs and O2 saturation of 89% on room air. Respiratory examination revealed increased AP diameter with bilateral expiratory wheezes in the posterior bases without any crackles. Cardiovascular exam showed JVP 2cm above sternal angle with normal S1 and S2 sounds without any murmurs or extra heart sounds. There were no peripheral edema noted. There were no worrisome findings on abdominal exam. </p>
</div>
<div id="page-three">
	<p>Investigations showed elevated WBC of 15 (with ANC of 13), normal electrolytes and normal troponin. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm and the CXR showed hyperinflated lungs with possible small area of consolidation in the RLL, no cardiomegaly and sharp costophrenic angles.

		<p>1. Dypsnea</p>
		<p class="answer">Most likely diagnosis: COPD exacerbation secondary to respiratory infection. We will order serial ABG’s and manage the patient with O2 therapy to maintain O2 saturation of 88-92%, combined albuterol and ipratropium 2 puffs via MDI q4-6 hours,  prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days and moxifloxacin 400mg PO once daily x 5 days. We will order sputum culture and sensitivity to clarify if there is a particular pathogen to target our antibiotics to. We will order a nasopharyngeal swab to rule out influenza.</p>
		<p class="answer">Differential diagnosis includes heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Heart failure is unlikely given the JVP is not elevated, there is no peripheral edema or an S3. Additionally the CXR reveals findings compatible with COPD (hyperinflation) and infection (a focal opacification) with no evidence of pulmonary edema or other signs of CHF. A BNP is not required to r/o CHF.  PE is similarly unlikely given we have an alternative explanation for the patients symptoms. We will not order d-dimer given the likelihood of high false positive and low pre-test probability.</p>
