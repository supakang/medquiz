<p>Mr. S. Nash is a 64 year old man with decompensated ESLD secondary to NASH, who presents with shortness of breath for 5 days.</p>
<p>Mr. Nash was in his usual state of health until 5 days ago when he began experiencing new, gradual onset, worsening SOB from being able to walk 15 blocks daily to 2 blocks since 5 days ago. This morning, he has been experiencing SOB at rest, which prompted him to come to hospital. He notes there is an associated non-productive cough with the SOB. In addition to this, the patient also complained of worsening abdominal discomfort over the past 2 weeks. He denies any abdominal pain, but says that he has been feeling increasingly bloated, similar to his previous episode of ascites which required drainage.</p>
<p>His past medical history includes cirrhosis which he is being followed by a gastroenterologist in the community. He had his first visit to the hospitals for his ascites requiring paracentesis 3 years ago but has been otherwise managed well on home regime of 100 mg spironolactone and 40 mg of Lasix. However, he was admitted to the hospital for worsening ascites 4 months ago which required therapeutic paracentesis and required an increased home diuretic dose to 200 mg of spironolactone and 80 mg of Lasix. His last liver ultrasound was 9 months ago and was negative for masses.  Currently, his MELD score 19 and Child Pugh class C. Aside from ascites, he has had no other complications of cirrhosis.</p>
<p>On ROS, he denies any chest pain, light headedness, or syncope.  There was no orthopnea, PND, or edema. There was no n/v/d, melena, hematochezia.  No fever, chills, sweats, weight loss. No calf tenderness. </p>
<p>The patient denies any history of cardiovascular disease. He has no risk factors for DVT such as recent immobility or surgery, or history of malignancy or DVT/PE.</p>

<div id="page-two">
<p>In the ED, he underwent a CXR which showed a new, moderate sized right-sided pleural effusion, but no evidence of consolidation, pulmonary edema, or cardiomegaly. A bedside abdominal ultrasound showed a large volume of intra-abdominal fluid. </p>
<p>His ECG showed NSR, initial and repeat troponins were normal. </p>
<p>On examination, the patient was alert, sitting up in bed breathing quickly and appeared jaundiced. His vital signs are as follows: HR 92 regular, BP 115/75, RR 24, O2 Sat 91% 4L NP, Temp 37.</p>
<p>On respiratory exam, there was dullness to percussion and decreased tactile fremitus and breath sounds at the right posterior base. The remainder of the lung fields were clear. </p>
<p>On cardiovascular exam, the JVP was 2cm ASA, normal S1/S2 was auscultated over the precordium with no gallops or murmurs. There was no peripheral edema. </p>
<p>Abdomen was distended, with bulging flanks. There was a positive fluid wave and shifting dullness. The abdomen was non-tender. There was no rebound tenderness. Liver edges were unable to be examined due to abdominal distention. </p>
<p>The labs in the ED showed normal Hgb, WBC and Cr, low plt at 100,000, low albumin of 30, INR of 2.2 and high bilirubin of 35. His liver enzymes were all mildly elevated, but were similar to his baseline values.</p>

		<p>We can lump dyspnea, non-productive cough and pleural effusion as one issue, as these symptoms are likely a constellation of one underlying issue.</p>
		<p>We can lump coagulopathy, liver enzymes and cirrhosis under just cirrhosis as this is likely to be the etiology.</p>
